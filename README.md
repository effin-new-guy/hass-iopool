Which prompted me after struggling with yaml (as I constantly do) to document (and share) the steps I took to integrate my iopool EcO Smart Water Monitor with Home Assistant 

___

### Prerequisites:
Home Assistant including the following:
- installed and running
- using [Home Assistant Secrets](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/secrets/) (for the api key)
- using [Home Assistant Pacakges](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/packages/)
  
iopool EcO Smart Water Monitor including the following:
- working with the iopool cOnnect wi-Fi Gateway (you can see entries in the app indicating everything is working with your EcO)

___
  
## Steps to get iopool in Home Assistant:

in the iopool app go to the settings page and at the bottom create an API key. 
create the following entry in secrets.yaml
```yml
iopool_api_key: AIzaSyClzfrOzB818x55FASHvX4JuGQciR9lv7q
```
(that is not my API key, so it will not work for you,  you need to input your API key in the secrets.yaml)

in the pacakges directory in Home Assistant installation create an iopool.yaml file and place the following code

```yml
rest:
  - resource: "https://api.iopool.com/v1/pools"
    headers:
      x-api-key: !secret iopool_api_key
    sensor:
      - name: iopool_title
        icon: mdi:pool
        value_template: "{{ value_json[0].title }}"

      - name: iopool_mode
        icon: mdi:pool
        value_template: "{{ value_json[0].mode }}"

      - name: iopool_action_required
        icon: mdi:alert-box
        value_template: "{{ value_json[0].hasAnActionRequired }}"

      - name: iopool_temperature
        icon: mdi:pool-thermometer
        unit_of_measurement: 'Â°F'
        value_template: "{{ (value_json[0].latestMeasure.temperature * 9 / 5 + 32) | int }}"  # degrees F
        # value_template: "{{'%0.1f' | format(value_json[0].latestMeasure.temperature) }}"  # degrees C

      - name: iopool_ph
        icon: mdi:ph
        unit_of_measurement: 'pH'
        value_template: "{{'%0.1f' | format(value_json[0].latestMeasure.ph) }}"

      - name: iopool_orp
        icon: mdi:scale-balance
        unit_of_measurement: 'mV'
        value_template: "{{ value_json[0].latestMeasure.orp }}"

      - name: iopool_filtration_duration_advice
        icon: mdi:pump
        unit_of_measurement: 'h'
        value_template: "{{ value_json[0].advice.filtrationDuration }}"
```

That is basically it.  
In Home Assistant, open Developer Tools, select "states" and type 'iopool' in the Entity and you should see multiple entries for the new sensors (screenshot below).

To get all the cool dashboard stuff, go back to ReenigneArcher's post where he makes the modest claim of not being the best at setting up cards and blatantly copy his awesome cards and add them to your Home Assstant dashboard then thumbs up his post
